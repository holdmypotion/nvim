# nvim - Neovim Configuration

Welcome to the **nvim** repository! This repository contains my personal configuration for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), aiming to provide a modern and efficient development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Neovim** - a highly extensible Vim-based text editor.
2. **Lazygit** - a simple terminal UI for Git commands.
3. **Ripgrep** - a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.

## Installation

To get started with this Neovim configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/holdmypotion/nvim ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. **Install Neovim:**
    - For Ubuntu:
      ```sh
      sudo apt-get install neovim
      ```
    - For macOS:

      brew install neovim
      ```

3. **Install Lazygit:**
